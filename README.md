# Shakespearean Language Model

This project implements a Transformer-based language model to generate text in Shakespearean English. The model is trained on a dataset of Shakespeare's works and can generate new Shakespearean-style text based on learned patterns in the text. The architecture is inspired by the research paper "Attention is All You Need" (Vaswani et al., 2017), which introduced the Transformer model. This model leverages the self-attention mechanism and feed-forward networks to capture long-range dependencies in text.

# Scraper

This repository also includes a scraper to extract Shakespeare's works into a JSON format to be processed into a CSV file for further training to create a conversational model.
